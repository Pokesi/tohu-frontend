export const tooltipInfoMessages = {
  tvl: t`Total Value Deposited, is the dollar amount of all TOHU staked in the protocol. This metric is often used as growth or health indicator in DeFi projects.`,
  mvt: t`Market Value of Treasury Assets, is the sum of the value (in dollars) of all assets held by the treasury.`,
  rfv: t`Risk Free Value, is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing TOHU.`,
  pol: t`Protocol Owned Liquidity, is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls. The more POL the better for the protocol and its users.`,
  holder: t`Holders, represents the total number of Exodians (sTOHU holders)`,
  staked: t`Staked supply is the percentage of circulating TOHU tokens which are currently staked.`,
  backing: t`Backing is the dollar value of non TOHU assets from the treasury backing a single TOHU.`,
  supply: t`Supply (Circulating/Total) represents the circulating and total amount of TOHU in existence. The circulating supply includes all staked TOHU, wsTOHU and TOHU in liquidity pools while the total also includes TOHU in the DAO treasury.`,
  apy: t`Annual Percentage Yield, is the normalized representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period over one year. Note that APYs provided are rather ballpark level indicators and not so much precise future results.`,
  runway: t`Runway, is the number of days sTOHU emissions can be sustained at a given rate. Lower APY = longer runway`,
  dilution: t`Dilution, is the ratio between index growth and total supply growth. It indicates how much stakers have been diluted. Slower decline is better.`,
  minted: t`TOHU Minted, is the number of TOHU minted each day from bonds`,
  mcs: t`TOHU minted/Total Supply, is the number of TOHU minted from bonds over total supply of TOHU.`,
  debtratio: t`Debt ratio, is a metric that tells you how much TOHU is currently vesting in relation to the total TOHU supply. The numbers dont reflect the actual values, but, it can be used to form an impression of how much TOHU is being minted from bonding in relation to the total supply.`,
  indexAdjustedPrice: t`Index adjusted price is the market price of TOHU times the index.`,
  growthOfSupply: t`Growth of Supply, is the growth of supply from bonding vs the growth of supply through the index/rebasing.`,
  tokenBalance: t`Token balances include all of the selected tokens held by the treasury in various places. Including spot, staking and liquidity.`,
  treasuryBreakdown: t`Treasury breakdown, breaks down our treasury assets by liquidity, risk free assets and risky assets.`,
  bondRevenue: t`Bond Revenue breaks down the treasuries daily revenue via bonding in the various asset types we offer as bonds.`,
  bondDiscounts: t`Bond discounts shows the discount for every bond which has been purchased by a user.`,
  premium: t`Premium is the ratio of market price over backing.`,
